👋 Hello and welcome to my Github! 

I'm Lolakshi (@Lola0802), an economics graduate with a passion for empirical economic research and data analysis. I am driven by my love for economic theory, a deep interest in leveraging data improve outcomes, both combined with a desire to effect change by informing decision-making and solving problems. 

### 🔍 What I'm Working On
I'm using this space to showcase my projects, collaborate with others, and share what I learn along the way. Here are some of the areas I'm most interested in:

    Evidence-Based Research: Employing robust data analysis to support policy recommendations.
    Applied Econometrics: Using statistical methods to interpret economic data and uncover trends.
    Data Visualization: Crafting intuitive and insightful visual representations of data.
    Public Policy Analysis: Analyzing policies through a quantitative lens to evaluate their impact.

### 👀 Current Projects (Work in Progress!)

Here are some of the empirical projects I'm currently working on or have recently completed:

    [Extending Dell 2010](https://github.com/Lola0802/Replicating_Dell_2010): Replicating and extending Dell's (2010) study on the Mita's (a colonial institution) lasting impact on modern economic outcomes in Peru.
    [DMLDiD for a policy reform](https://github.com/Lola0802/Machine-Learning-in-Econometrics): Estimating the causal effects of a family policy reform in Germany using double/debiased machine learning methods.
<!--  [Project Name 1]: A study on [Brief description of the project's objective or data source].
[Project Name 2]: Analysis of [Dataset/Policy] to investigate [Key Research Question].
[Project Name 3]: Visualization of [Economic Trend/Data] over time using [Tool/Software]. -->

Feel free to explore the repositories on my profile to see my work in detail. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions!
